This is called\nthe stage. Use the menu to see other pages.\nWhat is cancer staging?\nStaging is a way of describing where the cancer is located, if or where it has spread, and whether it is\naffecting other parts of the body. Doctors use diagnostic tests to find out the cancer’s stage, so staging\nmay not be complete until all of the tests are finished. Knowing the stage helps the doctor recommend\nthe best kind of treatment and can help predict a patient’s prognosis, which is the chance of recovery.\nThere are different stage descriptions for different types of cancer.\nIn general, a lower number stage of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is linked with a better\noutcome. However, no doctor can predict how long a patient will live with lung cancer based only on the\nstage of disease. This is because lung cancer is different in each person and treatment works\ndifferently for each tumor.\nThis page provides detailed information about the stage groups for NSCLC, such as stage II or stage\nIV, and what this means for prognosis.\nStage groups for NSCLC (https://www .cancer .net/cancer-types/lung-cancer-non-small-cell/stages#stage-groups)\nPrognosis (https://www .cancer .net/cancer-types/lung-cancer-non-small-cell/stages#prognosis)\nStage groups for NSCLC\nThe stage of NSCLC is based on a combination of several factors, including:\nThe size and location of the tumor\nWhether it has spread to the lymph nodes and/or other parts of the body.\nThere are 5 stages for NSCLC: stage 0 (zero) and stages I through IV (1 through 4). One way to\ndetermine the staging of NSCLC is to find out whether the cancer can be completely removed by a\nsurgeon. To completely remove the lung cancer, the surgeon must remove the cancer, along with the\nsurrounding, healthy lung tissue and often nearby lymph nodes. Learn more about treatment options\nfor NSCLC (http://www .cancer .net/node/19155) .\nStage 0\nThis is called in situ disease, meaning the cancer is “in place” and has not grown into nearby normal\nlung tissues or spread outside the lung.', metadata={'source': '../../data/input_folder\\Cancer.Net - Non Small Cell Stages.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='3/6/23, 5:29 PM Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell: Stages | Cancer .Net\nhttps://www .cancer .net/cancer-types/lung-cancer-non-small-cell/stages 2/4Stage I\nA stage I lung cancer is a small tumor that has not spread to any lymph nodes. Stage I is divided into 2\nsubstages based on the size of the tumor:\nStage IA tumors are 3 centimeters (cm) or less in size. Stage IA tumors may be further divided\ninto IA1, IA2, or IA3 based on the size of the tumor.\nStage IB tumors are more than 3 cm but 4 cm or less in size.\nStage II\nStage II lung cancer is divided into 2 substages:\nA stage IIA cancer describes a tumor larger than 4 cm but 5 cm or less in size that has not\nspread to the nearby lymph nodes.\nStage IIB lung cancer describes a tumor that is 5 cm or less in size that has spread to the lymph\nnodes within the lung, called the N1 lymph nodes. A stage IIB cancer can also be a tumor more\nthan 5 cm wide that has not spread to the lymph nodes.\nUsually, stage II tumors can be removed with surgery, but often additional treatments are\nrecommended.\nStage III\nStage III lung cancers are classified as either stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC. The stage is based on the size of\nthe tumor and which lymph nodes the cancer has spread to. Stage III cancers have often spread\nextensively to the lymph nodes, but have not spread to other distant parts of the body.\nIf stage III NSCLC is suspected, the doctor will want to make sure the cancer has not spread to other\nparts of the body. For this evaluation, ASCO recommends a physical examination, assessment of the\npatient’s medical history, a CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen, and a PET-CT scan and MRI of\nthe brain (see Diagnosis (http://www .cancer .net/node/19153) ). For some people, lymph nodes may also need\nto be tested for cancer by endoscopy (http://www .cancer .net/node/2451 1) or surgery. A team of cancer care\nspecialists generally work together to recommend the most appropriate treatment plan based on the\nstage and other characteristics of the cancer as well as other medical conditions the patient may have.\nFor many stage IIIA and stage IIIB cancers, it may be difficult, or sometimes impossible, to remove the\ntumor completely with surgery alone. Stage IIIC cancers, in general, cannot be removed with surgery\nand may need to be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiation followed by\nimmunotherapy. For example, the lung cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes located in the\ncenter of the chest, which is outside the lung. Or the tumor may have grown into nearby structures in\nthe lung. In either situation, it is less likely that the surgeon can completely remove the cancer. Stage III\nNSCLC that cannot be treated with surgery is generally treated with systemic therapy and radiation\ntherapy (see Types of Treatment (http://www .cancer .net/node/19155) ).\nThis information is based on the ASCO guideline, “Management of Stage III NSCLC\n(https://www .asco.org/practice-patients/guidelines/thoracic-cancer#/168762) .” Please note that this link takes you to a\ndifferent ASCO website.\nStage IV', metadata={'source': '../../data/input_folder\\Cancer.Net - Non Small Cell Stages.pdf', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content='3/6/23, 5:29 PM Lung Cancer - Non-Small Cell: Stages | Cancer .Net\nhttps://www .cancer .net/cancer-types/lung-cancer-non-small-cell/stages 3/4Stage IV means the lung cancer has spread to more than 1 area in the other lung, the fluid surrounding\nthe lung or the heart, or distant parts of the body through the bloodstream. Once cancer cells get into\nthe blood, the cancer can spread anywhere in the body. But, NSCLC is more likely to spread to the\nbrain, bones, liver, and adrenal glands. Stage IV NSCLC is divided into 2 substages:\nStage IVA cancer has spread within the chest and/or has spread to 1 area outside of the chest.\nStage IVB has spread outside of the chest to more than 1 place in 1 organ or to more than 1\norgan.\nIn general, surgery is usually not an option for most stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV lung cancers. It can be difficult\nto remove lung cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes above the collarbone or into vital structures\nwithin the chest. These include the heart, large blood vessels, or the main breathing tubes leading to\nthe lungs. In these situations, the doctor will carefully consider if surgery is an option or recommend\nother treatment options (http://www .cancer .net/node/19155) . Surgery is usually not be recommended if the\ntumor cannot be completely removed. But for some people with stage IV lung cancer that have a good\nresponse to treatment, surgery and/or radiation therapy may be offered to treat the remaining sites of\ncancer.\nRecurrent NSCLC\nRecurrent cancer is cancer that has come back after treatment. If the cancer does return, there will be\nanother round of tests to learn about the extent of the recurrence. These tests and scans are often\nsimilar to those done at the time of the original diagnosis (http://www .cancer .net/node/19153) .\nUsed with permission of the American College of Surgeons, Chicago, Illinois.

NSCLC is\ntreatable at any stage and new treatments in recent years have led to improvements in overall survival\nfor people with all stages of NSCLC. But only some people with certain stages can be cured.\nYour doctor may use an index known as ""performance status"" or ""functional status"" to guide your\ntreatment and determine your prognosis. This index measures a person\'s general strength and health.\nPeople who are strong enough to continue daily activities without assistance can safely receive cancer\nmedication, radiation therapy, or surgery. For people with bone or liver metastases from lung cancer,\nexcessive weight loss, ongoing tobacco use, or certain pre-existing medical conditions, such as heart\ndisease or emphysema, treatment may not be as safe or effective.\nIt is important to note that a person\'s age has never been useful in predicting to predict if a person will\nbenefit from treatment for NSCLC.
